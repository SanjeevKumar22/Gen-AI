Beneath the sun’s relentless glare,  
The fielders wait with patient care.  
A bowler’s run, a batter’s stance,  
The crowd holds breath for every chance.  

The willow cracks, the red ball flies,  
A fielder dives, the umpire’s eyes.  
Cheers erupt, the scoreboard grows,  
As cricket’s magic gently flows.
